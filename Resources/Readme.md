# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Learning Resources
Due to the limited systematic knowledge sharing on Zero-Knowledge Proofs available on the internet.
This repository aims to collect, categorize, and provide valuable resources for learning about Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).

<!-- ## Introduction

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are cryptographic methods that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they possess a certain piece of information, without revealing the information itself. This repository provides a comprehensive list of resources to understand, explore, and implement ZKP.

## How to Use

Navigate through the different categories based on your interests and needs. Each category contains a curated list of resources for different levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). -->
