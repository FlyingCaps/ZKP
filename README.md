# Zero Knowledge Proof & Cryptography Research



Welcome to our research repository focusing on Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Cryptography. 

## 📜 Introduction

Zero Knowledge Proofs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another party that they know a value, without revealing that value or any additional information. Coupled with traditional cryptography methods, ZKPs are pushing the boundaries of privacy and security in various applications, from cryptocurrencies to secure communications.
